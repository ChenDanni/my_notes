##### 1. Fourier Analysis of boolean function
a. linear independence(vector spaces)
  if none of the vectors in a set of vectors can be defined as a linear combination of other vectors.

b. verfity: standard basis can generate any other vectors in vector space

c. how to construct a multilinear polynominal for boolean function?

d. three different basis(standard, monomials, orthonormal)

e. why parity function can form a basis
